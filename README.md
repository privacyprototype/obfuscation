Instruction: 

1. Install all dependencies listed inside package.json by running:
npm install
(You will need to have Node.js installed on your machine, you can download it here: https://nodejs.org/en)

2. That should be it. Now, run the app inside your terminal with:
npm run dev

Navigate to localhost:3000 in the browser to check it out.

If encountering issues with NextJS file compilation, you can try:

Run this command to get the nvm.
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash

Restart your terminal.
